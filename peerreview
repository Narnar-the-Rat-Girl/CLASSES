Ashleys:
    Nikki:
    got most of her work done, had some minor bugs in the code
    
    Chloe:
    did alot of code but most of it had major bugs I had too spend hours debugging


Nikki's:

    Ashleys
        - Ashley did really well debugging and creating the classes she was assigned to and assisted me when I was confused on my own classes

    Chloe
        -  Chloe did her own classes, but she didn't really debug any of her code and we had to fix it ourselves
